## ME 359 Black and Decker Screwdriver Breakdown

### Project Overview

	The purpose of this project was to learn more about machine components and how they are produced and put together. By taking apart a relatively cheap, mass produced screwdriver and then analyzing it, it makes it possible to learn more about the engineering design process by looking at it in reverse. By being able to spot instances where DFMA tactics are implemented, observing how each component of the screwdriver fits into subassemblies and then into the final assembly, and observing the overall shape and size, it’s made clear that the seemingly simple design of the screwdriver had a lot of thought put into it. The portion of the project dedicated to analyzing the gearbox allows for a greater understanding on how gear ratios work, and some real-world applications of gear trains. It is another way to see all of the thought that must go into a design.


### Gearbox Analysis

  After taking apart the screwdriver, the individual parts of the gear train were analyzed, starting with the number of teeth (N). For the ring, planets, and the sun, N is found by simply counting the number of teeth. For the planetary carrier, however, N is found by using Equation 1.
